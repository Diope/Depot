Finished Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial and was recommended to go through Agile Web Development with Rails 4.
After I complete this I plan to go through Hartl's tutorial again. I supplement my rails learning by learning Ruby
with Pragmatic Studio's Ruby programming screencasts and their book on 1.9 & 2.0. Right now I'm studying Rails/Ruby
on average of 5 hours daily. Unfortunately I don't have more free time or I would do like 10hrs a day.
